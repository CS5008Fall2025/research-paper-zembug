# Research Paper
* Name: Emily Despres
* Semester: Fall 2026
* Topic: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)



Note the following is an example outline to help you. Please rework as you need, you do not need to follow the section heads and *YOU SHOULD NOT* make everything a bulleted list. This needs to read as an executive report/research paper. 

## Introduction
- What is the algorithm/datastructure?
- What is the problem it solves? 
- Provide a brief history of the algorithm/datastructure. (make sure to cite sources)
- Provide an introduction to the rest of the paper. 

Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is an algorithm inspired by the cooperative behavior of ants in nature. When ants search for food, they explore their environment and leave behind pheromone trails. These chemical signals act as a form of indirect communication, guiding other ants toward promising paths. Over time, trails along shorter or more efficient routes become stronger as more ants reinforce them, while less effective paths fade away. This simple biological process allows an ant colony, without any central control, to collectively discover near optimal solutions to complex problems such as finding the shortest path between their nest and a food source. ACO takes this idea and translates it into a computational model, where artificial “ants” explore graphs and update pheromone levels to gradually converge on good solutions. [1][2]

The algorithm was first introduced in the early 1990s by Marco Dorigo as part of his doctoral research. His initial version, called the Ant System (AS), laid the foundation for later refinements such as the Ant Colony System (ACS) and the MAX–MIN Ant System (MMAS), each designed to improve efficiency and avoid premature convergence. Since its introduction, ACO has grown into a family of related algorithms widely applied to NP‑hard problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem, vehicle routing, and scheduling. Instead of guaranteeing the absolute best answer, ACO uses probability and feedback to find solutions that are close to optimal in a reasonable amount of time. This report examines how the algorithm works, analyzes its complexity, presents test results, and explores real world applications in areas like telecommunications and logistics. By looking at both the strengths and challenges of ACO, the report shows how biologically inspired computing continues to provide creative strategies for solving difficult problems. [1][2]
